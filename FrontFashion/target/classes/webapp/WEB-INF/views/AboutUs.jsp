but also to recognize what people need. This means that we are always able to offer all the latest phones,
great prices, reliable service, fast delivery and premium customer support.</div>
<h2> The Story </h2>
<div>
Digital Bazzar website was launched in 2018, but its story actually began some 3 months before that when a group of college friends decided to go into business together. We started 
selling phones in shops, but our combined ambition, drive and abilities soon made us look for new challenges and new markets. Starting an
online shop provided for both and allowed us to develop a strong international presence in a number of EU countries.
